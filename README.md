# Kaggle-House-Prices
In this machine learning project we are required to estimate the price of the house given various attributes such as size , condition and other features.

This repository contains two versions with two different approaches.

  1.In the first approach I have implemented a Linear Regression Model.(Score obtained is 0.172)

  2.In the second one I have implemented a Gradient Boosting Model.(Score obtained is 0.152)
  
    PS:There are interactive and dynamic plotly charts after lines 12,16,22,25,36(not visible in the viewer on git.)
  
    Please download and run the same on your jupyter notebook to view (Completely interactive).
  
    Alternatively one can also visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/bike-sharing-demand". 
    (Although some plots are visible there and some are not even though kaggle supports plotly charts.)
    (If you know how to fix this please let me know.)
  
My Kaggle username is "sidagar" without quotes.
