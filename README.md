# Kaggle-House-Prices
In this machine learning project from kaggle we are required to estimate the price of the house given various attributes such as size, area, condition and a variety of other features. All these features have been described in the data_description.txt file uploaded along with the other files in this repository.

## This repository contains two folders with two different approaches.

  1. In the first approach I have implemented a Linear Regression Model.(Score obtained is 0.172).
  You can visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/house-prices-using-linear-regression" to view the notebook.

  2. In the second one I have implemented a Gradient Boosting Model.(Score obtained is 0.151)
  You can visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/well-commented-code-xgboosting" to view the notebook.
  
    PS:There are interactive and dynamic plotly charts in these files which are not rendered on the github viewer and 
    therefore I have uploaded the whole notebook in HTML format separately for reference which comes with all the graphs.
    If you only want to see the notebook you can download and view the HTML version or visit the kaggle link to view it.
    
    If you however wish to run the code on your own, you can either:
    
    1. Download the ipynb format of the notebook along with the train and test sets and set the path of train test inside 
       the notebook and run it on your computer. Before running please make sure to install all the relevant libraries.
    
    2. Visit kaggle links provided and fork the pinned version of the notebook and then run the notebook.
